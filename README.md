## 🧭 Overview

This project was developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the theme  
**"A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI"**.

It leverages **machine learning** and **AI-assisted data processing** to detect potential **exoplanets** from NASA's open-source datasets (Kepler, K2, and TESS missions).  
The system is fully containerized using **Docker** and exposes a REST API that can be integrated into web platforms like WordPress for interactive analysis.
